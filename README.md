# tuffyHackathons2021

Fun Project for TuffyHacks, CSUF's first 24-hour virtual hackathon

## Inspiration
The pandemic does affect people around me in multiple ways, especially for International Students. International Students that I know and I can't go back or have the ability to travel due to the % of getting COVID. 
## What it does
The Boring App is an entertainment application that provides almost everything users need for entertainment. Like someone famous said: "One bore + one bore = zero bore."

It has 4 main components:
1. Vid Land: Collection of Movies, TV Shown, and Youtube videos. Users can watch anything they want without having to switch to another app.
2. Potatoe Farm: Collection of Meme posts, news, discuss from 9Gag, Reddit, and other sites
3. Friends: You can make friends with other users, send messages, and check their "status."
4. Fav: You can save your favorite videos, post, or TV show to watch later. And it goes in here. 

## How we built it
During break time, I saw my roommates have to switch to multiple apps to entertain. My idea came from the moment. 

**The Boring App**'s design was created through a rushed design process. The app was designed first through discussion with my roommates about what features they are looking for. We(me) conducted quick research, created a user profile, and designed the rough draft.  

I used SwiftUI, Firebase Auth, FireStore, UIKit, Youtube V3, and various other technologies. 

## Challenges we ran into

Finding the correct document to implement Youtube V3 with SwiftUI 
Having some issues with layout and components
Implement MVVM model 
Have a hard time design some components
Bug, bug, and bug...

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
First-ever Hackathon so, I did learning lots of new stuff this time. Also, I was able to able some knowledge that I got from the workshops. 
Finished the custom Menu Layout

## What we learned
Get to know lots of packages and libraries.
Get to use to document 
Styling and components were definitely fun, even though it did give me some hard time debugging. 
Firebase implementation (storage, authentication, and a small part of client message) 
After 1xxx lines of code, Swift is surprisingly addicting.

## What's next for The Boring App
There are some more additional features that I would like to add to the application. First, I want to work on the "Potatoe Farm" section by finding good documents to implement 9Gag and Reddit APIs. Thus users can browse. The "Potatoe Far" is a "one-stop-shop" for online content like memes and news. Users can access switch to this feature without exiting the app. I plan to work on this but was cut short due to time. I would love to finish "Vid Land" by providing users more options to customize their own; thus each user experience is unique. Last but not least, I would be definitely want to finish the communication function (not only the user can send messages to each other, but also can have the ability to do video calls).
